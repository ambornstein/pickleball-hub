I just finished the basic authentication logic, but it's very rudimentary and reliant on context and has no memory of sessions. Up to this point the map and location submission are the main features that work. The site will soon be able to handle traffic, but not before the submission review system is in place. Also the front page should be adjusted to introduce the site better and hook users.

Accounts aren't as necessary for now but the authentication system is good to have for the route protection for my admin page. Once my page is up I can start adding fields to each pickleball location like times and court counts. It will be ok if users see placeholder reviews so that they know what to expect from the finished version.

At this point, I am happy about the state of the site's infrastructure, but polishing parts of UX and page content are absolutely essential going forward.
